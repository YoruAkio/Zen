## üì¶ How to Build

Building Zen is straightforward, and the following steps will guide you through the process. You can use **Termux** or any **Linux** command line.

### Requirements

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Clang**
- **[Termux-NDK](https://github.com/lzhiyong/termux-ndk)** (for Android development)

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Important**:
   Don't forget to set the location of your Termux-NDK toolchain in this [line](https://github.com/Zaenalos/Zen/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L3).

1. **Set up the Build Directory**:
   Create the build directory where the project files will be compiled:
   ```bash
   cd out/build
   ```

2. **Generate the Build Files**:
   Inside the `out/build` directory, generate the build files by running:
   ```bash
   cmake ../..
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Use the following command to build the project with multiple threads.
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --parallel
   ```

4. **Locate the Output**:
   After a successful build, the shared library `libZen.so` will be generated in [this](https://github.com/Zaenalos/Zen/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L32) directory (Feel free to modify the output location.).
